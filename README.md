Today, I'll be experimenting with Github Classroom for the first time!

Whenever I'm teaching, I try to make use of the tools that are being taught. To that end, today we'll be experimenting with using a continuous integration workflow in a version control system (git). 

Your task is simple, but beneath that simplicity lies complexity. Hopefully this will showcase the problems that we will later solve with a better-defined branching workflow. Today you'll solve it with your own 'ad hoc' solution - likely a combination of luck, speed and communication.

Here are your instructions for today:

1. In this repository, go to the file `shared-list/the-list.md`.
2. Click on the 'pen' icon at the top right of the file to edit it.
3. Working from the example, add an entry for yourself, including 
    1. your name, 
    2. how you'd like people to refer to you, 
    3. things from the first lesson that you 
        1. already knew about,
        2. learned enough about, and
        3. didn't understand fully, and
    4. an integer between `1` and `22` that **does not end up being used by another student** (this is the hard part).
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page. Enter a short message in the field under the heading "Commit Changes".
6. Change the radio button selection from "Commit directly to the main branch." to "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."
7. Click the big green "Propose Changes" button.

I will be approving pull requests **in the order they are submitted** provided that you've added some stuff to your entry and the number you provide for step 3.iv **hasn't been taken already**.
